    This class of biased language is often harder to detect than framing bias because of its subtle nature. It encompasses language constructs that aim at manipulating the believability of a statement. The typical mechanisms are either presupposing the truth or the falsehood of a statement. The misleading use of verbs (i.e. factive verbs) is common.

For instance, using verbs such as “boast” or “claim” leads the reader to examine the statement more critically compared to the verbs such as “say” or “state”.

As a result, statements seem to be either more believable or less. The misleading use of verbs (i.e. factive verbs) is common.
