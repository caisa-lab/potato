<p>
  This type of bias alters the reader's opinion by describing an event only from one particular point of view or frame. 
  There are two forms for framing bias:
  <ul>
    <li>Word choice (nouns or phrases: people, places, things, ideas, concepts). e.g. Both legal and <b>illegal aliens</b> will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.</li>
    <li>Labeling (adverbs or adjectives: describing nouns and pronouns). e.g. other Democrats visited a similar processing center in Clint, Texas, and made <b>explosive</b> allegations about the conditions there</li>
  </ul>
