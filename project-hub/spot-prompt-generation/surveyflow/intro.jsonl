This tool will help users to easily verify locations in digital media. <br />To be able to benchmark our system we need a dataset of human generated sentences that represent users searching for locations in SPOT. We have written clear descriptions of what we want you to do, all you need to do is to generate sentences. Per task we have specified what we need you to include in your sentences and in what style it should be written. <br /><br />Example sentences could look like this: <br />- Please find me all pharmacies 100m away from a traffic light in Berlin. <br />- I am looking for a fountain in a large park, there are also public benches in the park. Next to the park is a Thalia bookstore. <br />- A MacDonaldds within 200 meters from a Bauhaus in Cologne. I can also see a Porta nearby. <br /><br />Many thanks for your help, much appreciated. <br /><br />If you are ready, then please click on ‘Move Forward’. "]}
